# GoodReads-Scrapper

The script [GoodReadsScrapper.py](https://github.com/sushantgupta1206/GUPSUS02/blob/master/GoodReadsScrapper.py) is a python script to be run from a command line and it will ask the user for a username and password when executed, then authenticates the user to `http://www.Goodreads.com website`. The code then finds, retrieves and stores the top 10 popular quotes from **Mark Twain** in an autogenerated text file.  

**Technology Stack used :**   
> Python 2.7  
> Robobrowser Library in python  
> Beautifulsoup Library   

## The Output and inferences :   
  
My main objective while solving the question was to hit the website with correct credentials and then browse through the page of quotes to filter for the top 10 quotes by Mark Twain. 
  
Please check the output file [Top_10_quotes](https://github.com/sushantgupta1206/GUPSUS02/blob/master/Top10_Quotes.txt) here. It contains json objects listed in the original form. The file will be auto-generated when we run the code.    
  
**Steps to Run the code:**   
> 1. clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/sushantgupta1206/GUPSUS02.git` on the local machine  
> 2. Navigate to the folder `cd \GUPSUS01\`  
> 3. install dependencies using `pip install bs4` for beautiful soup; `pip install robobrowser` for installing Robobrowser  
> 4. Run the script `GoodReadsScrapper.py` by using `python GoodReadsScrapper.py`.
> 5. Enter valid user credentials
> 5. Please check the 'Top_10_quotes.txt' file in the same directory to verify the output. 

**Testing:**    
Please use this command to run the test file and check the results in the console : `python GoodReadsUnitsTests.py`
